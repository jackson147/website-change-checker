# WEBSITE MONITOR

Simple selenium script to poll a site and monitor it for changes.
Just uses a dead simple regexp for now, but could easily be expanded.

Use case was my wife needed to sign up to a course as soon as it was available, this watched the "Sign up not avaiable" button until it disappeared. Helped her get onto the course.
